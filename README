AVATAR the MMORPG

The plan is to create a Server and Client enabling the production of a computer game based on the universe of Avatar: the last airbender. 
It will be an open source product complying to all the associated rules and regulations. 

	� A character will be in a location in the world
	� A world will contain many locations split into regions
	� A region will have a minimum 4 main camps
	� Each camp will be for a specific clan
	� Each character will initially be in one clan only
	� Clan membership will be determined by standing towards each clan
	� Clan membership opens up access to missions with that clan
	� There are several levels of clan standing
	� If the clan standing is enemy then the NPCs of that clan can attack
	� If the clan standing is enemy then the Players of that clan can attack you as long as they are not friendly to your clan also.
	� Clan Standing of Honoured or above allows access to that clans bending abilities
	� Bending abilities can only be learned in the right order Air, Water, Earth, Fire, Air etc.
	� Bending abilities have levels from 1 to 4
	� The higher the level the more powerful the ability
	� There are side skills for Creating items
	� There are side skills for gathering resources
	� There are Combat skills separate from Bending Abilities
	� All players start at Friendly to their clan and Enemy to all others
	� Missions can lower standing against other clans
	� Once a player is at Honoured the standing cannot drop below that.
	� Players can attack other players only within 5 levels of themselves
	� Mounts can be obtained from level 20 up.
	� Earth mounts travel underground 
	� Air mounts fly
	� Fire mounts leave trails of fire behind them
	� Water mounts travel over water faster than ground
	� There are neutral villages dotted around the world offering missions that affect multiple standings. (air + fire -)


The server will be constructed in a modular way.
