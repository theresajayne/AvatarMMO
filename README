AVATAR the MMORPG

The plan is to create a Server and Client enabling the production of a computer game based on the universe of Avatar: the last airbender. 
It will be an open source product complying to all the associated rules and regulations. 

	• A character will be in a location in the world
	• A world will contain many locations split into regions
	• A region will have a minimum 4 main camps
	• Each camp will be for a specific clan
	• Each character will initially be in one clan only
	• Clan membership will be determined by standing towards each clan
	• Clan membership opens up access to missions with that clan
	• There are several levels of clan standing
	• If the clan standing is enemy then the NPCs of that clan can attack
	• If the clan standing is enemy then the Players of that clan can attack you as long as they are not friendly to your clan also.
	• Clan Standing of Honoured or above allows access to that clans bending abilities
	• Bending abilities can only be learned in the right order Air, Water, Earth, Fire, Air etc.
	• Bending abilities have levels from 1 to 4
	• The higher the level the more powerful the ability
	• There are side skills for Creating items
	• There are side skills for gathering resources
	• There are Combat skills separate from Bending Abilities
	• All players start at Friendly to their clan and Enemy to all others
	• Missions can lower standing against other clans
	• Once a player is at Honoured the standing cannot drop below that.
	• Players can attack other players only within 5 levels of themselves
	• Mounts can be obtained from level 20 up.
	• Earth mounts travel underground 
	• Air mounts fly
	• Fire mounts leave trails of fire behind them
	• Water mounts travel over water faster than ground
	• There are neutral villages dotted around the world offering missions that affect multiple standings. (air + fire -)
